Controllers as Instances:

Ensure singleton behavior.
Simplify route and middleware binding.
Easier to mock and test.
Services as Classes:

Provide flexibility for instantiation with different dependencies.
Support multiple configurations.
Allow state management specific to the instance.


Singleton behavior ensures a single, shared instance across the application.
Useful for managing global or shared resources like logging, configurations, and route handling.
Achieved in JavaScript by exporting an instance of a class and leveraging module caching.
While powerful, overusing singletons can lead to tight coupling and reduced testability, so use them judiciously.

Cascading behavior in databases refers to how changes in one table (usually a parent table) 
automatically affect related rows in another table (usually a child table) through foreign
key constraints. 

Cascading behavior is defined on the child table as part of the foreign key constraint because the child table 
contains the foreign key that references the parent table's primary key.
